# C4 Infrastructure, Configuration & Deployment Security

## Control Objective

AI infrastructure must be hardened against privilege escalation, supply chain tampering, and lateral movement through secure configuration, runtime isolation, trusted deployment pipelines, and comprehensive monitoring. Only validated and authorized infrastructure components reach production through controlled processes that ensure security, integrity, and auditability.
